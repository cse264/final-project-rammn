# Frontend Manual

## Description

In this folder, the Vue.js frontend is compiled and automatically moved to the backend folder where files are used by Python Flask.  In order to compile the frontend, first the necessary npm packages must be installed following the steps below.  Then, whenever the files need to be recompiled (after changes, etc.), building the Vue.js application will automatically compile the files and move them to the backend where the website can be hosted using Python Flask.

## Installation:

```
npm install OR yarn install
```

## Build:

```
npm run build
```
